### My name is Tim Hanewich, welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋
**Power Platform Technical Specialist at Microsoft by day, tireless tinkerer by night!** 

I was first exposed to to software development in middle school by [Roblox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox), using the [Lua programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)). This planted the seed that has now grown into what I love do every day. I picked development back up in 2018 and haven't put it down since!
